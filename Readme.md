# Super Awesome gosu game

* Warning a few copyright laws may have been streched/bent in the making of this game

## Setup

You just need gosu installed. Gosu has a few dependencies as outlined in the getting started docs in the wiki:  https://github.com/jlnr/gosu/wiki

Once those are met, just install the gem.

` gem install gosu `

and start the game!

` ruby start.rb `

## GamePlay

Fly around using the `directional arrow keys`, destroy enemies with `spacebar`, fling special shots with `enter`

Fair warning, it may seem easy at first, but the further you go, the harder it gets.
